# CuePilot AI: Presentation Script

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Image:** App Logo (CuePilot AI)
**Title:** CuePilot AI: Your Intelligent Presentation Co-Pilot
**Subtitle:** Effortless Control, Flawless Delivery.

**(Presenter):** Hello everyone, and thank you for joining. Today, we're going to talk about a common challenge for anyone who speaks in public: staying on script, managing slides, and engaging an audience, all at the same time. We've created a tool that doesn't just help you read a script, but acts as an intelligent co-pilot for your entire presentation. This is CuePilot AI.

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Image:** A split image showing a frustrated speaker juggling notes and a clicker on one side, and a calm, confident speaker on the other.
**Title:** The Presenter's Dilemma
**Bullet Points:**
*   Managing script, slides, and pace is difficult.
*   Traditional teleprompters are rigid and unintuitive.
*   Losing your place breaks your flow and connection with the audience.

**(Presenter):** Whether you're recording a video, giving a keynote, or leading a webinar, you've felt this pressure. You're trying to remember your lines, click to the next slide at the right moment, and maintain a natural pace. Traditional tools are clumsy. A simple teleprompter just scrolls at a fixed speed, and if you stumble, it keeps going without you. It's a disconnected experience.

## Slide 3: Our Solution: CuePilot AI

**Title:** An Intelligent Co-Pilot for Your Voice
**Key Message:** CuePilot AI listens, understands, and adapts to you.

**(Presenter):** CuePilot AI is different. We designed it from the ground up to be an intelligent partner. It uses AI to listen to your voice, understand your commands, and adapt to your natural speaking rhythm. It's not just a scroller; it's a co-pilot that puts you in effortless control.

## Slide 4: Core Functionality & UX

**Image:** A collage of UI elements: the sliders, the import menu, the overlay buttons.
**Title:** Designed for Focus and Control
**Bullet Points:**
*   **Intuitive Interface:** Clean, distraction-free layout with a focus on the text.
*   **Precise Controls:** Vertical sliders for speed, font size, and margins, with popovers for exact values.
*   **One-Click Import:** Seamlessly import scripts from Google Docs or entire presentations from Google Slides.
*   **Presenter Mode:** A dedicated, clean second-screen output for your audience or teleprompter hardware.
*   **Settings Presets:** Save and load your favorite configurations in an instant.

**(Presenter):** We started with a foundation of rock-solid teleprompter features, all wrapped in a user experience designed for focus. You can import your text from Google Docs or even a full Google Slides presentation. The interface is clean and intuitive. You can fine-tune every aspect of the display, from font size to margins, and even save your settings as presets to use later. And for professional setups, the "Assist Mode" provides a clean, synchronized output for a second monitor.

## Slide 5: The AI Magic: Enhanced Voice Control

**Image:** An animation or diagram showing a microphone icon, a sound wave, and then branching to icons for "Next Slide," "Pause," and a scrolling text.
**Title:** Your Voice is the Remote
**Key Features:**
1.  **Command Recognition:** The AI prioritizes direct commands.
2.  **Pace Matching:** If no command is heard, it matches the scroll speed to your voice.
3.  **Positional Awareness:** It knows where you are in the script.

**(Presenter):** But the real magic is how CuePilot AI listens. This is our "Enhanced Voice Control."

You can talk *to* the app. Say **"next slide,"** and it advances your presentation. Say **"pause,"** and it stops. You can even say **"go back to the part about data security,"** and the AI will find that phrase in your script and jump right to it. It understands commands for navigation, playback, and even in-text searching.

And when you're *not* giving a command? It seamlessly falls back to its other job: matching the scrolling speed to your natural reading pace, and periodically re-centering the text on the last word you spoke to ensure you never lose your place.

## Slide 6: From Slides to Script

**Image:** A view of the UI showing a slide in the main view and its corresponding speaker notes in the editor below.
**Title:** The Ultimate Presenter Workflow
**Key Features:**
*   **Synced Notes:** Import a Google Slides deck, and it automatically pulls in your speaker notes for every slide.
*   **Dual-Mode Prompter:** Toggle the main view between the slide image or the scrollable speaker notes.
*   **Automatic Slide Advancement:** When you finish reading the notes for one slide, the AI automatically advances to the next one for a seamless flow.

**(Presenter):** We've built the ultimate workflow for slide-based presentations. When you import a Google Slides deck, you get both your visuals and your script. You can choose what to see in the prompter: the slide itself, for a visual cue, or your speaker notes as a scrollable, voice-controlled script.

Best of all, when you're reading your notes, CuePilot AI knows when you've reached the end. It will automatically advance to the next slide and its notes, creating a completely hands-free and professional presentation experience.

## Slide 7: AI-Powered Script Editing

**Image:** A screenshot of the right-click context menu and the "Cleanup Script" button.
**Title:** A Smarter Editor
**Bullet Points:**
*   **One-Click Cleanup:** Press the "magic wand" icon to have AI instantly remove timecodes, format paragraphs, and capitalize speaker names.
*   **Contextual Assistance:** Right-click on any selection to get AI-powered help to fix grammar, rewrite for clarity, or reformat the text.

**(Presenter):** The AI assistance doesn't stop at voice control. We've also embedded it directly into the script editor. Have a script that's a mess, maybe copied from a transcript file? Our one-click "Cleanup" button uses AI to instantly reformat it into a professional, teleprompter-ready script.

For more surgical changes, just highlight any part of your text and right-click. The AI can fix spelling and grammar, or even rewrite the selection to make it more impactful.

## Slide 8: Security & Data Privacy

**Image:** Icons representing security: a lock, a shield, the Google logo.
**Title:** Your Content is Yours. Always.
**Bullet Points:**
*   **Secure Authentication:** We use Google's standard, secure OAuth for sign-in. Your password is never shared with us.
*   **On-Demand Access:** The app only requests temporary, read-only access to your files when you choose to import them.
*   **No Server-Side Storage:** Your scripts and presentation data are never stored on our servers. They are handled directly in your browser.
*   **Ephemeral AI Processing:** Audio and text snippets sent for AI processing are not stored or used for training by the model provider. The interaction is ephemeral.

**(Presenter):** Finally, and most importantly, let's talk about security. Your content is your intellectual property, and we treat it that way.

We use Google's own secure sign-in system, so we never see your password. When you import a file, you grant temporary, read-only permission. Your scripts are never saved on our servers; they live in your browser and are gone when you close the tab. The audio and text sent to the AI for processing are used only to get a response and are not stored or logged. Your content remains yours. Always.
